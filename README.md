# Task 5 – Wireshark Packet Capture & Protocol Analysis

## Objective
Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types.

## Tools
- Wireshark

## Steps
1. Captured traffic for ~2 minutes on active interface.
2. Browsed websites and performed ping test.
3. Applied filters for `http`, `dns`, and `tcp`.

## Protocols Identified
1. **HTTP** – Web traffic for website requests and responses.
2. **DNS** – Resolving domain names to IP addresses.
3. **TCP** – Reliable transport protocol used by HTTP and other services.

## Observations
- HTTP requests showed GET and response headers.
- DNS queries resolved `google.com` and other domains.
- TCP connections showed SYN, ACK handshake.

## Files
- Screenshots
